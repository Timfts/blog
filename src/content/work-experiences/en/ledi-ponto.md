description: In my first experience working in a team, I joined LEDI, a startup
  focused on access control solutions and automation of internal workflows for
  other organizations. My work was primarily front-end development with Angular,
  but also contributed to UI design using Adobe XD and occasionally handled
  back-end tasks using PHP with Laravel.
