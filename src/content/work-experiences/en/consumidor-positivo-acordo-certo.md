description: >-
  I'm currently a tech lead at Consumidor Positivo, a joint venture between Red
  Ventures and Equifax, formed by merging the IQ and Acordo Certo teams. The
  business focuses on debt renegotiation, credit products, and services related
  to credit scores.


  While my main expertise remains in front-end development, I now work in a more generalist roleâ€”contributing to back-end, CI, team management, and people development. I continue to drive creative tech solutions, leading the development of internal tools that bring together people with diverse skill sets to solve everyday challenges.
