  I worked in a dedicated team called IQ Contas, focused on automating utility
  bill payments. I joined as a junior developer and grew into a senior role,
  working mainly with React, React Native, and AWS. Over time, I also
  contributed to back-end development with Golang and serverless.


  I led the creation of internal tools like Blueberry (our design system) and Firebolt (a multi-step form builder), bringing more creativity and an collaborative mindset to the team.
