Blueberry was the design system for the old iq contas.

I’ll describe the project in more detail soon, whenever I’m feeling particularly nostalgic. I worked on it alongside a wonderful team, especially Gabriela Biscáro, who was the lead designer on the project (while I was the lead developer).

If you’re curious to know more, check out this post on Gabriela’s website, it covers many interesting details: [https://gabiscaro.com/projects/blueberry](https://gabiscaro.com/projects/blueberry)



I'll be back here soon
