The year was 2018, I was... well... 18 years old. Even though I had learned to program about 2 or 3 years earlier, I was just having my first steps into the professional world, doing some freelance jobs and banging my head against the wall trying to learn some new languages, frameworks, techniques...

Estudar tudo isso era assustador, mas ao mesmo tempo instigante. Eram tantas possibilidades: “o que eu vou escolher?”, eu pensava. Não sabia se deveria aprender a fazer APIs com Python, “ou quem sabe .NET?”, “já sei! Por que não aplicativos mobile?”, “quero aprender Java? Com certeza não!”, “React ou Vue?”... (concatene aqui mais uns milhares de pensamentos aleatórios).\

Studying all of this was scary, but exciting at the same time. There were so many possibilities: “What am I gonna choose?” I thought. I didn’t know if I should learn to build APIs with Python, “or maybe .NET?”, “I know! Why not start with mobile apps?”, “do I want to learn Java? Absolutely not!”, “React or Vue?”... (insert a million more random thoughts here).

At the end of the day, I ended up falling in love with front-end development, animations and microinteractions — Actually, it makes perfect sense, since I come from a family with a strong artistic background. Visual, aesthetic, creative and interactive things have always drawn me in way more than just writing code.

Well, I wasn't happy at all.
